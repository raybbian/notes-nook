Diodes, relays, and logic gates can all be made with electricity. These, made from transistors, form the basis of all modern computers.

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{N-type} transistor is normally ope\textbf{n} and propagates a strong 0 signal. The diagram does \textbf{n}ot have a bubble and has the drain on top and is connected to grou\textbf{n}d.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{P-type} transistor is normally closed and propagates a strong 1 signal. It is normally connected to \textbf{p}ower and has the drain on bottom and is connected to \textbf{p}ower.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{gate} is the input to a particular transistor.
\end{definition}

Note that a transistor cannot output many values, instead the output value will be indeterminate.
