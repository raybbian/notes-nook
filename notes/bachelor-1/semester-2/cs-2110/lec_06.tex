We can use kmaps to simplify a lot of the simplification down.

Can store state and memory with gates!

There are combinational logic circuits, which are like pure functions, and sequential logic circuits, which depend on state.

The minimum circuit necessary for sequential logic is an \textbf{RS Latch}

Gated D latches are made of RS Latches.

RS latches and Gated D's are level triggered (think of the clock cycle, it triggers on the top and bottom).

RS and Gated D latches store 1 bit of memory.
