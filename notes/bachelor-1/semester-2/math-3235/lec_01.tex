\section{Basics of Probability}

What data do you need to specify probability? You need the \textbf{set of all outcomes}, a list of everything that could possibly occur as a consequence, and the likelihood of each event.


\begin{eg}
	For a roll of a dice, the set of all outcomes would be \( \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}   \). The list could include things like ``the result is 3'', or ``the result is \( \ge 4 \)'', and the likelihood would be \( \frac{1}{6} \) for each of the results.
\end{eg}

\subsection{Basics of Set Theory}

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{set} is an unordered collection of elements. \textbf{Elements} are objects within sets.
\end{definition}
