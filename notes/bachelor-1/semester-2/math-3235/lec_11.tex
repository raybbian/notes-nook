\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{hazard rate}/failure rate is given by \[
		\lambda (t) = \frac{f(t)}{\overline{F}(t)}
	.\] where \( \overline{F} = 1 - F \). Suppose that an item has survived for a time \( t \) and we wish to find the probability that it will not survive for a longer \( dt \). Then \( \lambda (t) \) is the probability intensity that a \( t \) old item will die/fail.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
	What is the hazard rate of the exponential function?
\end{eg}
\begin{explanation}
	We have \[
		f_x(t) = \gamma e^{-\gamma t}  \quad t \ge 0
	.\] and that \[
		F_X(t) = 1 - e^{-\gamma t} 
	.\] from a previous class. Then \[
		\lambda (t) = \frac{\gamma e^{-\gamma t} }{e^{-\gamma t} } = \gamma \quad  t > 0
	.\] It doesn't depend on \( t \) (memoryless)! Also note that working backwards, \[
		\overline{F}_X = Ce^{-\lambda t} 
	.\] 
\end{explanation}

\begin{eg}
	A distribution function of positive continuous random variable can be specified by giving its hazard rate function. If a random variable has linear hazard rate function, \[
		\lambda (t) = a + bt
	.\] then \[
		\overline{F}_X = Ce^{-at - \frac{bt ^{2} }{2}}  
	.\] Noting that \( F_X(0) = 0 \), then we can solve for \( C \)), which is 1.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}
	Expectation of a continuous random variable is given by \[
		\mathbb{E}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\cdot f_X(x)dx 
	.\] 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	(Law of the subconcious statistician) If \( X \) is a continuous random variable, then \[
		\mathbb{E}(g(X)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)f_X(x)dx 
	.\] whenever this integral converges.
\end{theorem}
