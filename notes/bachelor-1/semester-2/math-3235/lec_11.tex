\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{hazard rate}/failure rate is given by \[
		\lambda (t) = \frac{f(t)}{\overline{F}(t)}
	.\] where \( \overline{F} = 1 - F \). Suppose that an item has survived for a time \( t \) and we wish to find the probability that it will not survive for a longer \( dt \). Then \( \lambda (t) \) is the probability intensity that a \( t \) old item will die/fail.
\end{definition}
