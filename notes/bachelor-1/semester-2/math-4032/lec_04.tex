\begin{lemma}
	(Simplest) For any positive integer \( n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \), \[
		2^{n-1} \le n! \le n^{n-1}  
	.\] 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We have for the lower bound
	\[
		n! &= \prod_{i=2}^{n}i \ge \prod_{i=2}^{n}2 = 2^{n-1}  
	.\] 
	And for the upper bound,
	\[
		n! = \prod_{i=2}^{n}i \le \prod_{i=2}^{n}n = n^{n-1}  
	.\] 
\end{proof}

Note that these bounds are very far off. Here is a motivating example.

\begin{eg}
	Suppose \( n \) students draw a card from a deck of \( n \) cards, replacing the card afterwards. What is the likelihood that all \( n \) cards drawn are distinct?
\end{eg}
