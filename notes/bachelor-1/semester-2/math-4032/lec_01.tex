\section{Introduction}

This course is basically just a second course in Combinatorics, and will cover a range of topics.

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{Matroids} are the structures that capture whether or not the greedy algorithm works. They will be covered later in the course.
\end{definition}

Now, for some examples and review:

\begin{definition}
	We say points are in \textbf{convex position} if no point is inside a triangle made by 3 other points.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
	Given a finite set of points on the plane, what is the maxmimum number of points such that no 3 are on a line, and no 4 are in convex position.
\end{eg}

\begin{explanation}
	Informally, we know that the ``outside'' of our points has exactly 3 points in the shape of a triangle. We can then place a point in the middle. However, if we try to add another point, then we find that 4 points are in convex position, which is a contradiction. Therefore, 4 points is the maximum size of such a set.
\end{explanation}

\begin{theorem}
	(ES, 1935) The maxmimum number of points such that no 3 are on a line and no \( n \) are in convex position is \( \le 4^n \) and \( \ge 2^{n-2}  \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	(Suk, 2017) This number is actually \( \le 2^{n + o(1)}  \)
\end{theorem}
