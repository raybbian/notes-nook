Recall that a graph is Sperner if it doesn't have any nested edges. We can prove the LMY inequality with this method:

\begin{replacementproof}
	We go by induction on \( n \), the number of vertices. We assume the lemma is true for \( n-1 \). Choose \( x \in V \) at random such that each vertex is chosen with probability \( \frac{1}{|V|} \). Set \[
		E_x = \{A \in E : x \not\in A\}  
	.\] 
\end{replacementproof}
