We will now review the types of proofs covered in Math-3012, as well as guidelines for writing them in this class.

\begin{prop}
	Let \( N \) be an \( n \)-element set and \( M \) be an \( m \)-element set. Then, there are \( m^n \) mappings (or functions) from \( N \) to \( M \).
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	(Inductive) ``We go by induction on \( n \). For the base case \( n=0 \), we consider the empty set \( \varnothing \) to be a mapping from the empty set to \( M \).
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
	If \( F \) is a mapping from \( N \) to \( M \), we write \( F: N \to M \).
\end{notation}
