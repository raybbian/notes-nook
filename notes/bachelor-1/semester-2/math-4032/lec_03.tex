\begin{notation}
	\( \tau : X \to X \) is a permutation \textbf{on} \( X \). Can also be denoted by \( \sigma : X \to X \).
\end{notation}

We will show that all permutations \( \tau  \) can be ``decomposed'' into ``cycles''.

\begin{eg}
	From the example earlier, \( (1,2) \) is a cycle, and \( (3,4,5) \) is another cycle.
\end{eg}

For the following, let \( \tau : X \to X \).

\begin{definition}
