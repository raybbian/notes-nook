\begin{lemma}
	For any graph \( G = (V,E) \), there exists a vertex \( v \) of small degree such that \[
		\deg(v) \le \frac{2|E|}{|V|}
	.\] 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	By the handshaking lemma, \[
		\frac{\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v)}{|V|} = \frac{\sum_{e \in E}|e|}{|V|} = \frac{2|E|}{|V|}
	.\] is the average degree of a vertex in the graph. Then, there exists \( v \in V \) whose degree is at most the average. Therefore, 
\end{proof}
