\begin{note}
	All normal graphs are Sperner, as all edges have the same size.
\end{note}

We will now prove that any Sperner hypergraph has at most \[
	\binom{n}{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}
.\] vertices.

\begin{lemma}
	(LMY-Inequality) If \( H=(V,E) \) is a Sperner hypergraph, and \( n=|V| \), then \[
		\sum_{A \in E} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{|A|}} \le 1
	.\] 
\end{lemma}
