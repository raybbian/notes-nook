If the dimension of \( V = n \) and you have linearly independent vectors, then you have a basis for \( V \).

Most of the time, we will look at subspaces of \( \mathbb{R}^{n}  \).

\begin{note}
	If we have a subset \( V \) of \( \mathbb{R}^{n}  \), to show that \( V \) is a subspace all we must do is show that if \( x,y \in V \), \( \alpha ,\beta \in \mathbb{R} \), then \( \alpha x+\beta y \in V \).
\end{note}
