\begin{eg}
	\[
		A = \begin{pmatrix}
			1 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1
		\end{pmatrix}
	\] is a matrix. We can also write \( A = \{a_{ij}\}   \) such that \( i = 1\ldots n \) and \( j = 1\ldots m \).
\end{eg}

What does it mean to take a product between a matrix and a vector?

\begin{definition}
	This product is defined as \[
		\begin{pmatrix}
			a_{11}x_{1} + a_{12}x_{2} + a_{13}x_{3} \\
			a_{21}x_{1} + a_{22}x_{2} + a_{13}x_{3} \\
			a_{31}x_{1} + a_{32}x_{2} + a_{33}x_{3} \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	.\] i.e. a collection of dot products between the rows and \( x \).
\end{definition}

We can also see the product as a linear combination.
