\begin{eg}
	Is every Hamiltonian graph connected?
\end{eg}

Yes. In order to find a Hamiltonian cycle, the graph must be connected.

\begin{eg}
	Is every connected graph Hamiltonian?
\end{eg}

No. Take the graph that is a square with an edge coming off one of the corners, for example.

\begin{eg}
	How many 3-colorings does the \( n \)-cycle have?
\end{eg}

Let \( F(n) \) be the number of proper colorings of a cycle of length \( n \) with colors 1, 2, 3. We wish to find \( F(10) \). Note that \( F(n) = 3\cdot 2^{n-1}\) minus the number of colorings of an \( n \)-vertex path where the first and last vertex are colored the same, denoted \( X(n) \). The key observation is that \( X(n) = F(n-1) \). It follows that \( F(n) = 3\cdot 2^{n-1}-F(n-1)  \).

\begin{eg}
	Is \( K_{3,3} \) with the bottom edge removed planar?
\end{eg}

Yes. We can rearrange it to be. Note that it also satisfies Euler's formula, where \( v = 6 \), \( m = 8 \), and \( f = 4 \).

\exercise{1}
How many edges does the hypercube graph \( Q_n \) have?

\exercise{2}
How can we find the general formula for \( F(n) = 3^{n-1} - F(n-1) \)?
